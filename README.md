## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/Open-Bytes/ChipGroup`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `
ChipGroup` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
      .package(url: "https://github.com/Open-Bytes/ChipGroup", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
    ]
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to `ChipGroup` in target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "ChipGroup"
        ]
        //...
    ),
   // ...
]
```

Then simply `import ChipGroup` wherever youâ€™d like to use the library.
